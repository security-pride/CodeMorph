if two adjacent statements has no shared variable with each other, you should change the order of the statements. 

The example in go is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a go code snippet with two functions:
"""
package main

import "fmt"

func func1() {
    a := 1
    b := 2
    fmt.Println(a)
    fmt.Println(b)
}

func func2() {
    c := 3
    d := 4
    fmt.Println(c)
    fmt.Println(d)
}
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should change the order of the statements in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
package main

import "fmt"

func func1() {
    a := 1
    b := 2
    fmt.Println(a)
    fmt.Println(b)
}

func func2() {
    d := 4
    c := 3
    fmt.Println(c)
    fmt.Println(d)
}
"""
That, the order of the statements 'c = 3' and 'd = 4' is changed.
