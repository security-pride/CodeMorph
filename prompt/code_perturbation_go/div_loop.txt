You should divide a large loop into two smaller loops. The divide rule is as following using mathematical expressions, you should be converted into the logical expression of the specified programming language:
1. If the start and end interval of the loop is [x,y), the times of the loop is n, that is n = x - y, choose a integer m that m <= n/2;
2. Divide the large loop into two smaller loops, the first loop interval is [x,n/m), the second loop interval is [n/m, y);

The pseudocode is as:
"""
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
    body1
}
"""
Then you should change it into two smaller loops, assuming that m = 2, the pseudocode is as:
"""
for i := 0; i < n/2; i++ {
    body1
}
for i := n/2; i < n; i++ {
    body1
}
"""
For example, in a go code snippet with two functions:
"""
import "fmt"

func func1() {
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}

func func2() {
    l := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    for i := 0; i < len(l); i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should divide the large loop into two smaller loops in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
import "fmt"

func func1() {
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}

func func2() {
    l := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    for i := 0; i < len(l)/2; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
    for i := len(l)/2; i < len(l); i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
"""
