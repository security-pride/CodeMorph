you should transform arithmetic logic to equivalent arithmetic logic by the transform rules followed, which is in go pseudocode, you should convert the expression according to the specified programming language:
1. a <= b should be transformed to !(a > b)
2. a >= b should be transformed to !(a < b)
3. a < b should be transformed to !(a >= b)
4. a > b should be transformed to !(a <= b)
5. a == b should be transformed to !(a != b)
6. a != b should be transformed to !(a == b)

For example, in a go code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    b = 2
    if a <= b:
        print("a is less than or equal to b")

def func2():
    c = 3
    d = 4
    if c >= d:
        print("c is greater than or equal to d")
    if c <= d:
        print("c is less than or equal to d")
    if c < d:
        print("c is less than d")
    if c > d:
        print("c is greater than d")
    if c != d:
        print("c is not equal to d")
    if c == d:
        print("c is equal to d")
    """
The entry_point is 'func2', you should transform arithmetic logic to equivalent arithmetic logic in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    b = 2
    if a <= b:
        print("a is less than or equal to b")

def func2():
    c = 3
    d = 4
    if not (c < d):
        print("c is greater than or equal to d")
    if not (c > d):
        print("c is less than or equal to d")
    if not (c >= d):
        print("c is less than d")
    if not (c <= d):
        print("c is greater than d")
    if not (c == d):
        print("c is not equal to d")
    if not (c != d):
        print("c is equal to d")
        """
