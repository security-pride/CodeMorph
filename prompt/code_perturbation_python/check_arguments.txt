you should check if the arguments is empty. If it is null, just print "Warning: Check the inputs" to the console, don't add any other code. 

The example in python is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    print("Hello World")

def func2(s):
    print(s)
"""
The entry_point is "func2", you should check if the arguments is empty in the function "func2". The rephrased code should be:
"""
def func1():
    print("Hello World")

def func2(s):
    if s is None:
        print("Warning: Check the inputs")
    print(s)
"""
