please jsut modify the operations: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=. No more than other operations should be modified.
You should follow the rule as below:
1. a += b should be changed to a = a + b
2. a -= b should be changed to a = a - b
3. a *= b should be changed to a = a * b
4. a /= b should be changed to a = a / b
5. a %= b should be changed to a = a % b


For example, in a Go code snippet with two functions, note that I don't change b++ or --b operations:

"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    a += 1
    print(a)

def func2():
    b = 2
    b -= 1
    b *= 2
    b /= 2
    b += 2
    b %= 2
    print(b)
"""

The entry_point is 'func2', you should modify the operations of the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:

"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    a += 1
    print(a)

def func2():
    b = 2
    b = b - 1
    b = b * 2
    b = b / 2  
    b = b + 2
    b = b % 2

    print(b)
"""
