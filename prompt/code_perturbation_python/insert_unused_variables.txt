you should insert unused variables. The added unused variables should not appear in the original function. The name of the unused variables should include 'important_var'.

The example in python is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:

"""
def func1():
    a = 5
    return a
def func2():
    b = 10
    print(b)
    c = b + 1
    return c
"""

The entry_point is 'func2', you should insert junk code in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code can be:

"""
def func1():
    a = 5
    return a

def func2():
    b = 10
    
    important_var1 = 0
    important_var2 = [1,2,3]
    
    print(b)
    c = b + 1
    return c
"""
That variable 'important_var1' and 'important_var2' are not used in the code.
