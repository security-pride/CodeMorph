you should insert junk loop code using for or while that won't be executed, the added loops that are never entered. 

In the loop, there can be various control flow statements such as "exit()", "return", and "break".

The example in python is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:

"""
def func1():
    a = 5
    return a
def func2():
    b = 10
    print(b)
    c = b + 1
    return c
"""

The entry_point is 'func2', you should insert junk code in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code can be:

"""
def func1():
    a = 5
    return a

def func2():
    b = 10
    for i in range(0):
        exit()
    
    print(b)
    c = b + 1
    return c
"""
That loop 'for i in range(0):' is never entered in the code.
