you should transform 'if' then 'continue' to 'if else'. You can use other placeholders to represent a do-nothing functionality to replace 'continue' such as "pass" in python, {} in C++, etc. I will give you the pseudocode to introduce the transformation rule in python, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.

Transformation rule:
The 'if' then 'continue' pseudocode is as:
"""
if condition:
    bodyA
    continue
bodyB
"""
Then you should change it into 'if else', the pseudocode is as:
"""
if condition:
    bodyA
    pass
else:
    bodyB
"""

For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    for i in range(5):
        if i == 3:
            continue
        print(i)
def func2():
    for j in range(3):
        if j == 2:
            continue
        print(j)
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should transform the if then continue statement to if else in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
def func1():
    for i in range(5):
        if i == 3:
            continue
        print(i)
def func2():
    for j in range(3):
        if j == 2:
            pass
        else:
            print(j)
"""
