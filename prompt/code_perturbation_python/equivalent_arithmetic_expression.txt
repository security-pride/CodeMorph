you should change the arithmetic computation or arithmetic assignment equivalently by adding and then minusing the same type number in the arithmetic expression such as "+ 3 -3". Note that, you can only change the arithmetic computation or arithmetic assignment which like 'a = 4', 'a = 5*3', 'b = 4.3', 'a = 6/2', 'a = 4 - 3' that only includes numeric constants.

The example in python is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    a = 5
    return a

def func2():
    b = 10
    c = 5.1
    d = func1()

    print(b)
    print(c)
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should change the arithmetic expression in the function 'func2'. In 'func2', the variable 'b' is equivalent 10, and you can add 3 and minus 3 to 'b'.  The rephrased code can be like:
"""
def func1():
    a = 5
    return a

def func2():
    b = 10 + 3 - 3
    c = 5.1 + 1 - 1
    d = func1()
    print(b)
    print(c)
"""
