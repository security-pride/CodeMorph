You should divide the composed if statement. If the if statement is composed, you should divide it into multiple if statements.

The format in python is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
The divide rule with pseudocode:
1. conditionA and conditionB:
"""
if conditionA and conditionB:
    body
"""
Then you should divide it into:
"""
if conditionA:
    if conditionB:
        body
        """
2. conditionA or conditionB:
"""
if conditionA or conditionB:
    body
"""
Then you should divide it into:
"""
if conditionA:
    body
elif conditionB:
    body
"""
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        print("Hello World")
def func2():
    if d >0 and e > 0:
        print("Hello World")
        """
The entry_point is "func2", you should divide the composed if statement in the function "func2". The rephrased code can be:
"""
def func1():
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        print("Hello World")
def func2():
    if d > 0:
        if e > 0:
            print("Hello World")
            """
