You should divide the 'if else-if else' statement into 'if else if else'. You should follow the rule to divide the 'if else-if else' statement as below which in python, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code:
The 'if else-if else' pseudocode is as:
"""
if conditionA:
    bodyA
elif conditionB:
    bodyB
else:
    bodyC
    """
Then you should change it into 'if else if else', the pseudocode is as:
"""
if conditionA:
    bodyA
else:
    if conditionB:
        bodyB
    else:
        bodyC
"""

For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    
def func2():
    b = 2
    if b > 2:
        print("b is greater than 2")
    elif b == 2:
        print("b is equal to 2")
    else:
        print("b is less than 2")
        """
The entry_point is 'func2', you should divide the if else-if else statement into if else if else in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:

"""
def func1():
    a = 1
def func2():
    b = 2
    if b > 2:
        print("b is greater than 2")
    else:
        if b == 2:
            print("b is equal to 2")
        else:
            print("b is less than 2")
"""
