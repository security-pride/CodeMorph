please transform "switch"/"match" structure to "if" statement. The format is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
The "match" structure to "if" statement transformation should be like:
"""
match value:
    case condition1:
        body1
    case condition2:
        body2
    case _:
        body3
"""
After transformation, the pseudocode should be like:
"""
if value == condition1:
    body1
elif value == condition2:
    body2
else:
    body3
"""
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    if a == 1:
        print("Hello World")
    else:
        print("Goodbye World")

def func2():
    value = 1
    match value:
        case 1:
            print("One")
        case 2:
            print("Two")
        case _:
            print("Invalid")
"""

entry_point is 'func2', you should transform the code in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    if a == 1:
        print("Hello World")
    else:
        print("Goodbye World")

def func2():
    value = 1
    if value == 1:
        print("One")
    elif value == 2:
        print("Two")
    else:
        print("Invalid")
"""
