if two adjacent statements has no shared variable with each other, you should change the order of the statements. 

The example in python is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    b = 2
    print(a)
    print(b)
def func2():
    c = 3
    d = 4
    print(c)
    print(d)
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should change the order of the statements in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
def func1():
    a = 1
    b = 2
    print(a)
    print(b)
def func2():
    d = 4
    c = 3
    print(c)
    print(d)
"""
That, the order of the statements 'c = 3' and 'd = 4' is changed.
