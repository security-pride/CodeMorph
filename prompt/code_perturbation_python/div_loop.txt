You should divide a large loop into two smaller loops. The divide rule is as following using mathematical expressions, you should be converted into the logical expression of the specified programming language:
1. If the start and end interval of the loop is [x,y), the times of the loop is n, that is n = x - y, choose a integer m that m <= n/2;
2. Divide the large loop into two smaller loops, the first loop interval is [x,n/m), the second loop interval is [n/m, y);

The pseudocode is as:
"""
for i in range(n):
    body1
"""
Then you should change it into two smaller loops, assuming that m = 2, the pseudocode is as:
"""
for i in range(n/2):
    body1
for i in range(n/2, n):
    body1
"""
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
def func2():
    l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(l)):
        print(i)
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should divide the large loop into two smaller loops in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
def func1():
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
def func2():
    l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(l)/2):
        print(i)
    for i in range(len(l)/2, len(l)):
        print(i)
"""
