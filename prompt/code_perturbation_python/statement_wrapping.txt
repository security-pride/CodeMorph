you should wrap the statements with if or for statement. The format in python is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
As a statement 'target_statement' in the code snippet:
1. The wrapping rule with if statement is:
if true:
    target_statement
    
2. The wrapping rule with for statement is:
for i in range(1):
    target_statement

For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    print("Hello World")

def func2():
    print("Hello World")
"""

The entry_point is "func2", you should wrap the statements with if or while or for statement in the function "func2". The rephrased code can be:
"""
def func1():
    print("Hello World")
def func2():
    for i in range(1):
        print("Hello World")
"""
