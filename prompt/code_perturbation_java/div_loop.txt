You should divide a large loop into two smaller loops. The divide rule is as following using mathematical expressions, you should be converted into the logical expression of the specified programming language:
1. If the start and end interval of the loop is [x,y), the times of the loop is n, that is n = x - y, choose a integer m that m <= n/2;
2. Divide the large loop into two smaller loops, the first loop interval is [x,n/m), the second loop interval is [n/m, y);

The pseudocode is as:
"""
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    body1
}
"""
Then you should change it into two smaller loops, assuming that m = 2, the pseudocode is as:
"""
for (int i = 0; i < n/2; i++) {
    body1
}
for (int i = n/2; i < n; i++) {
    body1
}
"""
For example, in a java code snippet with two functions:
"""
    public static void func1() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }

    public static void func2() {
        int[] l = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should divide the large loop into two smaller loops in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
    public static void func1() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }

    public static void func2() {
        int[] l = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int i = 0; i < l.length / 2; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
        for (int i = l.length / 2; i < l.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
"""
