you should move the assignment if a variable is assigned directly and the type of variables are int or float or double or char or string. Then you replace it with: Declare the variables first, then assign values as same as the original values in the next line.

The example in java is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example: in a java code snippet with two functions:

"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 1;
        return a;
    }

    public static int func2() {
        int aa = 1;
        return aa;
    }
"""

The entry_point is "func2", then the assignment value should be "1" of the variable "aa" in function "func2". And you should assign the value to the variable "aa" first, then call the function. The rephrased code should be:

"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 1;
        return a;
    }

    public static int func2() {
        int aa = 0;
        aa = 1;
        return aa;
    }
"""
