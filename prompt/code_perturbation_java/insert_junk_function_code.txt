you should insert junk function code that won't be executed, the added functions that are never called. 

In the insert junk function, there can be various control flow statements such as "exit()", "return", and "break", the function name should be accordingly.

If the code is cpp or java, you should insert junk anonymous functions. 

The example in java is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
def func1():
    a = 5
    return a
def func2():
    b = 10
    print(b)
    c = b + 1
    return c
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should insert junk code in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code can be:

"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 5;
        return a;
    }

    public static int func2() {
        int b = 10;

        Runnable exitProcess = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                System.exit(0);
            }
        };

        System.out.println(b);
        int c = b + 1;
        return c;
    }
"""
That function 'exit_process' is not called in the code.
