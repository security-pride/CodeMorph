if two adjacent statements has no shared variable with each other, you should change the order of the statements. 

The example in java is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a java code snippet with two functions:
"""
    public static void func1() {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
    }

    public static void func2() {
        int c = 3;
        int d = 4;
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(d);
    }

"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should change the order of the statements in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
    public static void func1() {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
    }

    public static void func2() {
        int d = 4;
        int c = 3;
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(d);
    }
"""
That, the order of the statements 'c = 3' and 'd = 4' is changed.
