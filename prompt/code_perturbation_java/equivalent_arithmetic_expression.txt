you should change the arithmetic computation or arithmetic assignment equivalently by adding and then minusing the same type number in the arithmetic expression such as "+ 3 -3". Note that, you can only change the arithmetic computation or arithmetic assignment which like 'a = 4', 'a = 5*3', 'b = 4.3', 'a = 6/2', 'a = 4 - 3' that only includes numeric constants.

The example in java is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a java code snippet with two functions:
"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 5;
        return a;
    }

    public static void func2() {
        int b = 10;
        double c = 5.1;
        int d = func1();  

        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);
    }
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should change the arithmetic expression in the function 'func2'. In 'func2', the variable 'b' is equivalent 10, and you can add 3 and minus 3 to 'b'.  The rephrased code can be like:
"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 5;
        return a;
    }

    public static void func2() {
        int b = 10 + 3 - 3;   
        double c = 5.1 + 1 - 1; 
        int d = func1();  

        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);
    }
