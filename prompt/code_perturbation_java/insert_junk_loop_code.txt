you should insert junk loop code using for or while that won't be executed, the added loops that are never entered. 

In the loop, there can be various control flow statements such as "exit()", "return", and "break".

The example in java is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a java code snippet with two functions:

"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 5;
        return a;
    }

    public static int func2() {
        int b = 10;
        System.out.println(b);
        int c = b + 1;
        return c;
    }
"""

The entry_point is 'func2', you should insert junk code in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code can be:

"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 5;
        return a;
    }

    public static int func2() {
        int b = 10;
        for (int i = 0; i < 0; i++) {
            System.exit(0);
        }

        System.out.println(b);
        int c = b + 1;
        return c;
    }
"""
That loop 'for (int i = 0; i < 0; i++)' is never entered in the code.
