you should insert unused variables. The added unused variables should not appear in the original function. The name of the unused variables should include 'important_var'.

The example in python is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:

"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 5;
        return a;
    }

    public static int func2() {
        int b = 10;
        System.out.println(b);
        int c = b + 1;
        return c;
    }
"""

The entry_point is 'func2', you should insert junk code in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code can be:

"""
    public static int func1() {
        int a = 5;
        return a;
    }

    public static int func2() {
        int b = 10;

        int importantVar1 = 0;
        int[] importantVar2 = {1, 2, 3};

        System.out.println(b);
        int c = b + 1;
        return c;
    }
"""
That variable 'important_var1' and 'important_var2' are not used in the code.
