you should infix experession dividing. If the experession is as: variable1 = variable2 op1 variable3 op2 variable4, and the priority of op2 is higher than or equal to that of op1, you should change it as: temp_variable = variable3 op variable4; variable1 = variable2 op temp_variable. You should name the temp_variable with a confused name that don't indicate that this is a temporary variable.

The example in java is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a java code snippet with two functions:
"""
    public static void func1(double b, double c, double d) {
        double a = b + c / d;
        System.out.println(a);
    }

    public static void func2(double f, double g, double h) {
        double e = f / g + h;
        System.out.println(e);
    }
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should infix experession dividing in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
    public static void func1(double b, double c, double d) {
        double a = b + c / d;
        System.out.println(a);
    }

    public static void func2(double f, double g, double h) {
        double z = f / g;
        double e = z + h;
        System.out.println(e);
    }
"""
