you should transform arithmetic logic to equivalent arithmetic logic by the transform rules followed, which is in java pseudocode, you should convert the expression according to the specified programming language:
1. a <= b should be transformed to !(a > b)
2. a >= b should be transformed to !(a < b)
3. a < b should be transformed to !(a >= b)
4. a > b should be transformed to !(a <= b)
5. a == b should be transformed to !(a != b)
6. a != b should be transformed to !(a == b)

For example, in a java code snippet with two functions:
"""
    public static void func1() {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        if (a <= b) {
            System.out.println("a is less than or equal to b");
        }
    }

    public static void func2() {
        int c = 3;
        int d = 4;

        if (c >= d) {
            System.out.println("c is greater than or equal to d");
        }
        if (c <= d) {
            System.out.println("c is less than or equal to d");
        }
        if (c < d) {
            System.out.println("c is less than d");
        }
        if (c > d) {
            System.out.println("c is greater than d");
        }
        if (c != d) {
            System.out.println("c is not equal to d");
        }
        if (c == d) {
            System.out.println("c is equal to d");
        }
    }
    """
The entry_point is 'func2', you should transform arithmetic logic to equivalent arithmetic logic in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
    public static void func1() {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        if (a <= b) {
            System.out.println("a is less than or equal to b");
        }
    }

    public static void func2() {
        int c = 3;
        int d = 4;
        
        if (!(c < d)) {
            System.out.println("c is greater than or equal to d");
        }
        if (!(c > d)) {
            System.out.println("c is less than or equal to d");
        }
        if (!(c >= d)) {
            System.out.println("c is less than d");
        }
        if (!(c <= d)) {
            System.out.println("c is greater than d");
        }
        if (!(c == d)) {
            System.out.println("c is not equal to d");
        }
        if (!(c != d)) {
            System.out.println("c is equal to d");
        }
    }
