for each if statement, you should improve its condition by adding an else clause, and just prints a warning message to the console in the added condition. 

The format in java is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code:

1. For more complex if-else statement:
If the original code is:
"""
if (condition1) {
    code1
} else if (condition2) {
    code2
} else {
    code3
}
"""
The rephrased code should be:
"""
if (condition1) {
    code1
} else if (condition2) {
    code2
} else if (!condition1 && !condition2) {
    code3
} else {
    System.out.println("Warning: The condition is not satisfied");
}
"""

Note that, you just add print("Warning: The condition is not satisfied") in the added condition clause, and do not change the original code.
