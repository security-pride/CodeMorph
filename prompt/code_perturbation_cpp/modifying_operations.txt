please jsut modify the operations: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=. No more than other operations should be modified.
You should follow the rule as below:
1. a += b should be changed to a = a + b
2. a -= b should be changed to a = a - b
3. a *= b should be changed to a = a * b
4. a /= b should be changed to a = a / b
5. a %= b should be changed to a = a % b


For example, in a cpp code snippet with two functions, note that I don't change b++ or --b operations:

"""
#include <iostream>

void func1() {
    int a = 1;
    a += 1;
    std::cout << a << std::endl;
}

void func2() {
    int b = 2;
    b -= 1;
    b *= 2;
    b /= 2;
    b += 2;
    b %= 2;
    b++;
    --b;
    std::cout << b << std::endl;
}
"""

The entry_point is 'func2', you should modify the operations of the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:

"""
#include <iostream>

void func1() {
    int a = 1;
    a += 1;
    std::cout << a << std::endl;
}

void func2() {
    int b = 2;
    b = b - 1;
    b = b * 2;
    b = b / 2;
    b = b + 2;
    b = b % 2;
    b++;
    --b;
    std::cout << b << std::endl;
}
"""
