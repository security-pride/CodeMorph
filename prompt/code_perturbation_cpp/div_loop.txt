You should divide a large loop into two smaller loops. The divide rule is as following using mathematical expressions, you should be converted into the logical expression of the specified programming language:
1. If the start and end interval of the loop is [x,y), the times of the loop is n, that is n = x - y, choose a integer m that m <= n/2;
2. Divide the large loop into two smaller loops, the first loop interval is [x,n/m), the second loop interval is [n/m, y);

The pseudocode is as:
"""
for (int i(0); i < n; i++){
    body1
}
    
"""
Then you should change it into two smaller loops, assuming that m = 2, the pseudocode is as:
"""
for (int i(0); i < n/2; i++){
    body1
}
for (int i(n/2); i < n; i++){
    body1
}
"""
For example, in a python code snippet with two functions:
"""
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void func1() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }
}

void func2() {
    std::vector<int> l = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (size_t i = 0; i < l.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }
}

"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should divide the large loop into two smaller loops in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void func1() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }
}

void func2() {
    std::vector<int> l = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (size_t i = 0; i < l.size() / 2; ++i) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }
    for (size_t i = l.size() / 2; i < l.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }
}
"""
