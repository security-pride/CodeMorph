you should insert junk function code that won't be executed, the added functions that are never called. 

In the insert junk function, there can be various control flow statements such as "exit()", "return", and "break", the function name should be accordingly.

If the code is cpp or java, you should insert junk anonymous functions. 

The example in cpp is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a cpp code snippet with two functions:
"""
#include <iostream>

int func1() {
    int a = 5;
    return a;
}

int func2() {
    int b = 10;
    std::cout << b << std::endl;
    int c = b + 1;
    return c;
}
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should insert junk code in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code can be:

"""
#include <iostream>

int func1() {
    int a = 5;
    return a;
}

int func2() {
    int b = 10;

    auto exit_process = []() {
        exit(0);
    };

    std::cout << b << std::endl;
    int c = b + 1;
    return c;
}
"""
That anonymous function 'exit_process' is not called in the code.
