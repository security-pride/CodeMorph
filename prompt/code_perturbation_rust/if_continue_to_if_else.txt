you should transform 'if' then 'continue' to 'if else'. You can use other placeholders to represent a do-nothing functionality to replace 'continue' such as "pass" in python, {} in C++, etc. I will give you the pseudocode to introduce the transformation rule in rust, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.

Transformation rule:
The 'if' then 'continue' pseudocode is as:
"""
if condition {
    bodyA
    continue;
}
bodyB
"""

Then you should change it into 'if else', the pseudocode is as:
"""
if condition {
    bodyA
    {}
} else {
    bodyB
}
"""

For example, in a rust code snippet with two functions:
"""
fn func1() {
    for i in 0..5 {
        if i == 3 {
            continue; 
        }
        println!("{}", i);
    }
}

fn func2() {
    for j in 0..3 {
        if j == 2 {
            continue; 
        }
        println!("{}", j);
    }
}
"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should transform the if then continue statement to if else in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
fn func1() {
    for i in 0..5 {
        if i == 3 {
            continue; 
        }
        println!("{}", i);
    }
}

fn func2() {
    for j in 0..3 {
        if j == 2 {
        } else {
            println!("{}", j);
        }
    }
}
"""
