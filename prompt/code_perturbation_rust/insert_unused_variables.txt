you should insert unused variables. The added unused variables should not appear in the original function. The name of the unused variables should include 'important_var'.

The example in rust is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a rust code snippet with two functions:

"""
fn func1() -> i32 {
    let a = 5;
    a 
}

fn func2() -> i32 {
    let b = 10;
    println!("{}", b); 
    let c = b + 1; 
    c
}
"""

The entry_point is 'func2', you should insert junk code in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code can be:

"""
fn func1() -> i32 {
    let a = 5;
    a 
}

fn func2() -> i32 {
    let b = 10;
    
    let important_var1 = 0; 
    let important_var2 = vec![1, 2, 3]; 

    println!("{}", b); 
    let c = b + 1; 
    c 
}
"""
That variable 'important_var1' and 'important_var2' are not used in the code.
