you should infix experession dividing. If the experession is as: variable1 = variable2 op1 variable3 op2 variable4, and the priority of op2 is higher than or equal to that of op1, you should change it as: temp_variable = variable3 op variable4; variable1 = variable2 op temp_variable. You should name the temp_variable with a confused name that don't indicate that this is a temporary variable.

The example in rust is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example, in a rust code snippet with two functions:
"""
fn func1(b: f64, c: f64, d: f64) {
    let a = b + c / d;
    println!("{}", a);
}

fn func2(f: f64, g: f64, h: f64) {
    let e = f / g + h;
    println!("{}", e);
}

"""
The entry_point is 'func2', you should infix experession dividing in the function 'func2'. The rephrased code should be like:
"""
fn func1(b: f64, c: f64, d: f64) {
    let a = b + c / d;
    println!("{}", a);
}

fn func2(f: f64, g: f64, h: f64) {
    let z = f / g;
    let e = z + h;
    println!("{}", e);
}
"""
