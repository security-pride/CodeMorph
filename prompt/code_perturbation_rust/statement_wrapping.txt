you should wrap the statements with if or for statement. The format in rust is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
As a statement 'target_statement' in the code snippet:
1. The wrapping rule with if statement is:
if true{
    target_statement
}
    
    
2. The wrapping rule with for statement is:
for i in 0..1 {
    target_statement
}

For example, in a rust code snippet with two functions:
"""
fn func1() {
    println!("Hello World");
}

fn func2() {
    println!("Hello World");
}
"""

The entry_point is "func2", you should wrap the statements with if or while or for statement in the function "func2". The rephrased code can be:
"""
fn func1() {
    println!("Hello World");
}

fn func2() {
    for _ in 0..1 {
        println!("Hello World");
    }
}
"""
