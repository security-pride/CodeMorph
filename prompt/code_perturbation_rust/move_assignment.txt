you should move the assignment if a variable is assigned directly and the type of variables are int or float or double or char or string. Then you replace it with: Declare the variables first, then assign values as same as the original values in the next line.

The example in rust is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.
For example: in a rust code snippet with two functions:

"""
fn func1() -> i32 {
    let a = 1;
    a
}

fn func2() -> i32 {
    let aa = 1;
    aa
}
"""

The entry_point is "func2", then the assignment value should be "1" of the variable "aa" in function "func2". And you should assign the value to the variable "aa" first, then call the function. The rephrased code should be:

"""
fn func1() -> i32 {
    let a = 1;
    a
}

fn func2() -> i32 {
    let aa: i32 = 0; 
    let aa = 1; 
    aa
}
"""
