you should add exception handling blocks. The exception handling block should catch the exception of the given exception_type and print the exception message to the console. The exception handling block should be added at the positions where code can go wrong. 

The format in rust is as follows, you should adapt it to the programming language of the given code.

The original rust code block is:
"""
codeA
codeB
"""
Adn if the codeA is the position where code can go wrong, then you add the exception handling block should be added in the following format:
"""
if let Err(e) = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
    codeA;
}) {
    println!("{:?}", e);
}

codeB;
"""

The exception_type is the type of the exception that you should catch.
